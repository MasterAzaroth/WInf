    <div class="biography">
        <p>
            Socrates was a Greek philosopher who lived in Athens during the 5th century BCE. He is widely considered one
            of
            the founders of Western philosophy and his contributions to the field of ethics and morality continue to be
            highly
            influential even today. Despite not having written any works of his own, Socrates' ideas have been preserved
            through
            the writings of his students, Plato and Xenophon.
            <br><br>
            Socrates was born in Athens and lived during a time of great political and social upheaval. Despite this, he
            devoted
            his life to seeking wisdom and understanding through philosophical inquiry. He was famous for his Socratic
            method of
            questioning, which involved asking a series of questions in order to arrive at a deeper understanding of a
            subject.
            This method of inquiry became a cornerstone of Western philosophy and continues to be used in universities
            and schools today.
            <br><br>
            Socrates believed that the pursuit of knowledge was the path to a virtuous life, and that by understanding
            the truth about
            the world and ourselves, we could lead happier and more fulfilling lives. He also believed in the existence
            of absolute
            truth and that the truth could be discovered through honest and open inquiry. This led him to question many
            of the commonly
            held beliefs of his time, which earned him the reputation of being a troublemaker and a thorn in the side of
            the Athenian establishment.
            <br><br>
            Despite this, Socrates was highly respected by his fellow Athenians and was widely admired for his wisdom
            and moral character. He
            was famous for his unwavering commitment to truth and his refusal to compromise his beliefs even in the face
            of persecution. This
            is demonstrated in his trial and eventual execution, where he was charged with impiety and corrupting the
            youth of Athens. Despite
            the serious consequences, Socrates refused to retract his beliefs and chose to drink hemlock, the poison
            that was used to carry out his sentence.
            <br><br>
            Socrates' legacy continues to be felt today, as his ideas about ethics, morality, and the pursuit of
            knowledge continue to be studied and
            discussed by scholars and students around the world. He is remembered as a martyr for truth, who died for
            his beliefs and continues to
            inspire and challenge generations of philosophers and thinkers.

        This work is a record of Socrates' defense during his trial in 399 BC. It provides a detailed account of
        Socrates' beliefs and philosophy, including his
        thoughts on justice, virtue, and the role of the philosopher in society.
        <br><br>
        In "The Apology", Socrates argues that he is innocent of the charges against him, but that even if he were
        guilty, he would still continue to live
        his life in accordance with his beliefs. He emphasizes the importance of speaking the truth and living a
        virtuous life, even if it leads to his
        own death. The work is widely regarded as a masterpiece of Western literature and is considered one of the
        foundational texts of Western philosophy.
        <br><br>
        A famous quote is:
        <hr class="quote-horizontal-line">
        <i>"The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing."</i>
        <br>
        <b> ~ Socrates</b>
        <hr class="quote-horizontal-line">
        This quote highlights the importance of humility and the role it plays in achieving wisdom and understanding. By
        recognizing
        that we do not know everything, we are better equipped to learn and grow, which allows us to make better choices
        and decisions.
        <br><br>
        Socrates' ideas about ethics, morality, and logic continue to shape the way that people think about these
        topics. He is considered
        one of the founding figures of Western philosophy, and his works continue to be widely read and studied by
        students and scholars
        around the world. His legacy continues to inspire people to question their beliefs, seek knowledge, and live a
        virtuous life.
