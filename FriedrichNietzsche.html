    <div class="biography">
        <p>
            Friedrich Nietzsche was a German philosopher, cultural critic, and poet who lived from 1844 to 1900. He is
            considered one of the most influential thinkers
            of the 19th century, and his works continue to be widely read and studied today. Nietzsche's philosophy is
            marked by a rejection of traditional morality
            and religion, and a focus on individual will, power, and creativity. He is perhaps best known for his
            concepts of the "will to power" and the "eternal recurrence."
            <br><br>
            Born in RÃ¶cken, Germany, Nietzsche was the son of a Lutheran pastor and grew up in a deeply religious
            family. Despite his background, he later turned away
            from Christianity and instead sought to find meaning and purpose in the natural world. He studied classical
            literature, philology, and philosophy at the
            University of Bonn and later at the University of Leipzig, where he wrote his doctoral thesis on the ancient
            Greek philosopher, Theognis of Megara.
            <br><br>
            Nietzsche's philosophical ideas began to take shape in his early 20s, when he first encountered the works of
            Arthur Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer's philosophy
            of pessimism and rejection of the will to live had a profound impact on Nietzsche, and he went on to develop
            his own unique philosophy that centered around
            the will to power and the concept of eternal recurrence.
            <br><br>
            In his first major work, "Thus Spoke Zarathustra," Nietzsche introduced the idea of the "superman" - an
            individual who is able to transcend conventional
            morality and create his or her own values. This idea was further developed in his later works, such as
            "Beyond Good and Evil" and "The Genealogy of Morals."
            Through these works, Nietzsche sought to challenge the traditional values and beliefs of his time, and
            encourage individuals to embrace their own individuality
            and creativity.
            <br><br>
            In his later years, Nietzsche's health began to deteriorate and he suffered from a series of mental and
            physical breakdowns. He died at the age of 55 in Weimar,
            Germany. Despite his relatively short life, Nietzsche's impact on the field of philosophy has been profound,
            and his ideas continue to inspire and influence
            new generations of thinkers.

        This book is widely considered Nietzsche's masterpiece, and is a must-read for anyone interested in his
        philosophy. Through the character of Zarathustra,
        Nietzsche explores the concept of the "superman" and challenges conventional beliefs about morality and
        religion.

        One quote everone has heard at least once in their life is from Nietzsche:
        <hr class="quote-horizontal-line">
        <i>"That which does not kill us makes us stronger"</i>
        <br>
        <b> ~ Friedrich Nietzsche</b>
        <hr class="quote-horizontal-line">
        It is often considered one of his most famous quotes, as it encapsulates his philosophy of life and his
        perspective on hardship and suffering.
        <br><br>
        For Nietzsche, the quote was meant to convey the idea that overcoming challenges and hardships can build
        character and resilience. It speaks to the idea that
        we are defined not by what we face, but by how we choose to face it. By enduring difficulties and overcoming
        obstacles, we grow stronger and develop a deeper
        sense of who we are and what we are capable of.
        <br><br>
        In this sense, the quote speaks to the idea that adversity can be a source of strength and growth, rather than
        simply a source of pain and suffering.
        By embracing challenges and working through difficult situations, we can build a stronger and more resilient
        sense of self, and grow into the best
        version of ourselves.
