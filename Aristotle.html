    <div class="biography">
        <p>
            Aristotle was a Greek philosopher who lived from 384 to 322 BC. He is considered one of the greatest
            thinkers in Western philosophy and has had a
            lasting impact on the fields of logic, metaphysics, ethics, politics, and biology.
            <br><br>
            Aristotle was a student of Plato and went on to become the tutor of Alexander the Great. He was a prolific
            writer and his works covered a wide
            range of topics, including ethics, politics, and natural sciences. Aristotle's philosophy emphasized the
            importance of reason and observation,
            and he believed that through careful study and observation, individuals could gain knowledge and
            understanding about the world around them.
            <br><br>
            One of Aristotle's most famous contributions to philosophy was his ethics, which emphasized the importance
            of leading a virtuous life. He believed
            that individuals could develop moral character through habits and practices and that the ultimate goal of
            life was to achieve happiness and fulfillment.
            He also believed that politics was a crucial aspect of leading a virtuous life, and that individuals should
            participate in the political process in order
            to improve the world around them.
            <br><br>
            In addition to his ideas about ethics and politics, Aristotle also made significant contributions to the
            field of logic. He believed that through reason
            and observation, individuals could gain knowledge and understanding about the world around them. He also
            believed that by developing good reasoning skills,
            individuals could better understand the world around them and make informed decisions.
            <br><br>
            Aristotle's influence on philosophy has been immense. His ideas about ethics, politics, and logic continue
            to shape the way that people think about these
            topics. He is also considered one of the founding figures of Western philosophy, and his works continue to
            be widely read and studied by students and
            scholars around the world.

        In this book, Aristotle explores the concept of ethics and how individuals can lead virtuous lives. He argues
        that happiness is the ultimate goal of human
        life and that it can be achieved through living a virtuous life. The book is widely regarded as one of the most
        influential works in Western philosophy
        and continues to be widely read and studied.

        One of the most famous quotes from Aristotle is:
        <hr class="quote-horizontal-line">
        <i>"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit"</i>
        <br>
        <b> ~ Aristotle</b>
        <hr class="quote-horizontal-line">
        This quote highlights the importance of forming positive habits in our daily lives in order to achieve
        excellence. By repeating positive actions, we become the embodiment
        of excellence, making it a part of who we are. This quote reminds us that true success and greatness are not
        achieved through occasional acts of greatness,
        but through consistently performing small acts of excellence over time.
